As a seasoned software developer with a strong background in information technology, I am passionate about crafting high-quality code that empowers users to efficiently accomplish their tasks. To achieve this, I prioritize writing robust unit tests, integration tests, and ensuring that each instruction has a positive impact on the overall application. I adhere to best practices in software engineering and continuously strive for improvement. My proficiency in Java has led to expertise in Spring Boot, and I have also worked with Spring Cloud, Redis, Kafka, Maven, Jenkins, and React. Additionally, I have experience with DevOps tasks, including deploying servers to cloud platforms and configuring quality assurance tools. I am particularly interested in distributed systems, microservices architecture, backend development, and artificial intelligence.
