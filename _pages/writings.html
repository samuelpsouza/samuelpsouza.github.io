                    This post is about me trying to review some of the things I've forgotten about frontend development
                    in the last three years.
                    Since I accepted a position as a Java backend developer at the beginning of 2019, I have practiced
                    almost nothing related to
                    HTML and CSS. So, I started this personal blog to review all things necessary to sharpen my skills.
                    My first intention is to
                    build a blog that looks like a 2000s website. Then, I will update it to a modern style by writing
                    posts here.
